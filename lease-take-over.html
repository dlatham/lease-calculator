  <p><strong>Lease Take Over: Your  Way Out of a Car Lease</strong></p>

  <p>The idea of a car lease is to have the opportunity to use a  car and, in essence, pay for the value of the car according to your time of  usage. For instance, when you get a two-year car lease on a $20,000 vehicle,  you will only pay for the difference of the car’s principal amount and the  car’s depreciated value. This is a more convenient option for people who want  to use a car without having to pay for the hefty monthly bills. They don’t get  to own the car—hence, their deal has no equity or resale value (primarily  because the car wasn’t purchased in the first place)—but they don’t have to  deal with high monthly charges and owning a property that, quite frankly,  cannot be considered as an investment.</p>

  <p>However, no matter how cheaper it is to get a car lease,  there are instances when people have to get out of a car lease. Legally,  getting out of a car lease is possible—one will just have to pay hefty  penalties, making the lease cancellation moot and pointless. Why cancel a lease  when you can pay for the expensive penalties anyway? Fortunately, there is  another way out of a car lease—the lease take over.</p>

  <p>The lease take over—also known as swap a lease—is exactly  what the term describes. It allows you to get out of a lease by passing the  payment obligations of the lease to another person—naturally, someone who wants  to get a car through leasing. Needless to say, it is a flexible and somewhat  practical way of ending a car lease earlier than what is indicated in the contract.  Simply put, instead of finishing the lease, the other person gets of what  remains of the lease period (meaning, he can use the car for that long). Of  course, he gets the financial obligations as well. It is a transfer of the  lease ownership. If the new lease owner wants to extend the lease after the  lease take over or wants to own the car by the end of the lease, it is already  his call. </p>

  <p>There are, of course, some repercussions before engaging  into this kind of transaction. First, it should be noted that not all leasing  companies allow a lease take over within any point of the contract. Meanwhile,  there are others that do not allow the lease takeover during the last few days  of the contract. Either way, you should try to consider this before settling  with a particular car leasing company. After all, you would not know whether  certain circumstances will prevent you from finishing your car lease. You  wouldn’t want to be stuck with the lease even when you cannot. </p>

  <p>Also, a lease take over means the transfer of lease  ownership. However, some leasing companies make the original owner of the car  lease liable when the new owner fails to finish the car lease or when the new  owner fails to make the payments. This is the reason why many consider the  lease take over as something that should be done between relatives or close  relations only. You wouldn’t want to risk paying for the lease when you aren’t  even using the car!</p>

  <p>On the other side of the fence, is a lease take over  practical? It definitely is—in fact, it is more practical for them than for the  ones who original own the car lease. And the reason is simple: when one takes  over a lease, he only takes the responsibility of paying for the remaining  monthly payments. However, he wouldn’t have to pay for the other fees that the  original lease owner made. Granted, a car lease does not require a deposit, but  it still involves the payment of various fees—from security deposits to  financial charge. You wouldn’t be able to get that back so, in a way, this can  be considered as your penalty for not finishing the loan contract. </p>

  <p>Just the same, a lease take over remains to be a practical  choice when you have no choice but to give up lease ownership. Lease contracts  can be very difficult to deal with, especially when you fail to finish your  obligations. As a way out of legal troubles, the lease take over is a very wise  choice.</p>
