  <p><strong>Lease versus Buy: The  Car Ownership Decision</strong></p>

  <p>To lease a car or to buy a car—what is the better option?  Indeed, a car lease and a car purchase both have their distinctive benefits and  disadvantages. It isn’t possible to determine which of the two is actually  better. Naturally, it depends on what you expect after the payments and what  you can actually afford during a pre-set period of time. </p>

  <p>When you buy a car, it is only imperative that you will own  the vehicle after you have paid for the loan. However, with this entails the  responsibility of paying for the cost of the car entirely. When buying any kind  of vehicle, you have to pay the down payment, the sales taxes (which can be  paid in cash or included into the loan), and the interest rate. And, of course,  you pay for the monthly payments, the first of which should be paid after a  month from signing the contract.</p>

  <p>A car lease, in essence, works the same, since you will also  have to pay for monthly dues. However, you do not pay for the vehicle entirely.  Rather, you only pay for a portion of its cost. You will pay for the portion  you used up. If your car lease contract is for a year, the car lease requires  you to pay for the car’s one year value.</p>

  <p>A more concrete example: You will lease a $10,000 car for  one year. After a year, its estimated value will be down to $5,000. Therefore,  you will only pay $5,000 for that year. When you buy a car, you pay $10,000.  Besides this, you need to pay for the sales tax (which is usually included in  the monthly payments), a security deposit, and a money factor (the car lease  equivalent of a loan).</p>

  <p>Needless to say, a car lease offers lower monthly payments  compared to buying a car.</p>

  <p>But is it worth? Again, it will depend on what you want,  provided that you can afford both options. In a car lease, you pay for the  depreciation charge; when buying one, you pay for the principal. In essence,  the value of the car, regardless if it is on a car leasing or purchase, remains  the same. What changes is what you paid for. If you are plans are more on the  short term, a car leasing would be more beneficial. However, it should be noted  that a car lease is more expensive on the long term, provided that the  intention is t keep the car after the loan. Buying a car, then, would be the  more appropriate choice. </p>

  <p>In the end, how is one better than the other? Car leasing  allows you to get a car for lower monthly payments without any resale value or  equity (naturally, because you don’t own the car). This is perfect for people  who wants to drive (not really own) a new vehicle every one, two, or three  years. Purchasing a car, on the other hand, is the best choice for people who  can afford high monthly payments, do not want to be bothered with any possible  car lease complications, and want to really own the car.</p>
