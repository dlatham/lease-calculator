  <p><strong>Drive a Car the Cheap  and Practical Way: How to Lease a Car</strong></p>

  <p>Buying a car is one of the major rites of passage for many  people around the world. It depends on country to country, culture to culture,  but the fact remains: the purchase of one’s first car is also considered as  among a person’s first major purchase, only a few ranks below buying a house or  a real estate property. And with the way the car industry is doing these days,  it’s not difficult to buy a brand new car. The current terms for buying a car are  very friendly, thanks to the economy’s less than sterling status. </p>

  <p>However, some people may still not be able to buy a car;  these vehicles are worth cheap change, after all. A number of people, on the  other hand, aren’t too sure that buying a car is indeed a worthy purchase. It  cannot be considered as an investment, and its resale value decreases and  depreciates year after year. What’s the purpose of paying for something when  its value wouldn’t be the same next year, and the year after that? This money  can be used for more worthwhile purpose, such as funds for actual investments.</p>

  <p>Luckily, there’s an option beyond purchasing a car: car  leasing.</p>

  <p>In essence, when you lease a car, you only pay for the  period you used the car. Of course, a car lease is much more complicated than  that. To be more exact, you are playing for the car’s depreciation value during  your car lease term. Remember that unlike the value of real estate, the value  of a car depreciates every year. Therefore, instead of paying for a monthly  loan, you pay for the residual value according to the length of your car lease. </p>

  <p>For instance, you get a car lease for a $10,000 car. In two  years, its estimated value is $8,000. You will pay $2,000, divided into 24  months, plus additional fees (as in a regular loan), because this is  technically the value of the car you used. </p>

  <p>So how does the process work? Of course, the key here is to  find a car with a low manufacturer’s suggested retail price and high residual  value.</p>

  <p>Let’s start with the manufacturer’s suggested retail price,  which is pretty much what it is. It is, obviously, the price of a particular  car—the sticker price, so to speak. The manufacturer’s suggested retail price  (or the MSRP, for short) does not include dealer fees, although that (among  other charges) should be included in the overcall car cost. </p>

  <p>In any case, you have to talk to your dealer regarding the  car’s sticker price. When you have agreed on a specific price, this will be  your capitalize cost, the price which will be the basis of your monthly  payments for the car loan. Do not believe a dealer when he says that the  sticker price is non-negotiable. More often than not, it is—the dealer simply  doesn’t want you to haggle, since it will cut down his revenue. In most cases,  however, the sticker price can be reduced. Also, try to find out if the  capitalized cost can be further reduced. Sometimes, a cash down payment can  make it lower, among others. The lower your capitalized cost, the lower the  lease payments will be. This is your goal, naturally.</p>

  <p>Now that you have your capitalized cost set up, your next  concern would be the car’s residual value. </p>

  <p>The residual value is the car’s worth after the car lease  contract. Again, the value of a car depreciates through the years. The  difference of the MSRP and the residual value will the price of your car lease  monthly payment. </p>

  <p>For instance, the residual of a $10,000 car on a two year  loan is 75 percent. This means its value after two years will still be at  $7,500. The difference is $2,500—so you will only pay for that amount in a span  of 24 months. Now, if the residual of the car is 50 percent, its end value is  $10,000. The monthly car lease you will have to pay is a whopping $10,000 in a  span of 24 months. Of course, a 75 percent residual value doesn’t exist. You’ll  actually lucky to find a car with around 50 percent. In fact, when looking for  a car to lease, try to find one with at least 50 percent residuals.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that the residuals of cars tend to fall  rapidly during the first two years of the car. After that, the residuals fall  slowly, making a long term car lease more practical than a short term car  lease. The difference between the car lease terms for two years and three years  would be significantly large. Toyota, Honda, Volkwagen, Mercedes, and generally  most Japanese and European cars depreciate slowly. American models, on the  other hand, tend to fall faster in terms of value. This is definitely something  to consider when getting a car lease.</p>

  <p>Lastly, you have you to consider the car lease’s money  factor. In a loan, this would be your interest rate. You pay for this annually  and can be computed by multiplying the factor (as it is sometimes called) by  2400. Remember: the money factor is always lower or of the same value as the car’s  loan interest rate. The factor can depend on your credit rating; the better it  is, the lower the money factor. With this in mind, it should be noted that  people with not so good credit rating cannot be able to avail of the money  factor since the risk in a car lease is far greater than in your usual loan.  The more flawed your credit rating is, the higher the interest rate will be. </p>

  <p> A car lease does not  necessarily offer more savings. Still, in terms of shorter periods, a car lease  would seem to be a practical choice. If you do not have a fat bank account to  fund the purchase of a car or if you would rather invest your money on  something that can actually increase in terms of value, then a car lease is the  right option for you. </p>
